I am Xiaowei Chen, a Postdoctoral Associate at the Lyles School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University. My research is dedicated to optimizing **Electric and Shared Mobility systems** to enhance their efficiency, robustness, and sustainability. By integrating data analysis, machine learning, reinforcement learning techniques, optimization methodologies, and agent-based simulators, I develop innovative operational strategies and models that address the critical challenges of modern transportation systems.

My work spans several key areas, including the generation of synthetic datasets, the development of energy-efficient routing models, and the evaluation of system performance with a focus on equity in charging infrastructure distribution. With a strong foundation in optimization methodologies and agent-based simulation, I aim to create practical solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world application.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about mentoring the next generation of engineers and contributing to the academic community through teaching and collaborative projects.
