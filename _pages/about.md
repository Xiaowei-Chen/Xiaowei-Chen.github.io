I am Xiaowei Chen, a Postdoctoral Associate at the Lyles School of Civil Engineering, Purdue University. My research is dedicated to optimizing _**Electric and Shared Mobility systems**_ to enhance their efficiency, robustness, and sustainability. By integrating _**data analysis, machine learning, reinforcement learning techniques, optimization methodologies, and agent-based simulators**_, I develop innovative operational strategies and models that address the critical challenges of modern transportation systems.

My work spans several key areas, including <u>Synthesis Datasets Generation & Data Analytics</u>, <u>Operational Model Development</u>, and <u>System Performance & Equity Evaluation</u>. I am dedicated to establishing a strong bridge between theory and practice, continuously seeking opportunities to bring cross-disciplinary insights to bear on long-standing challenges.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about mentoring the next generation of engineers and contributing to the academic community through teaching and collaborative projects.
